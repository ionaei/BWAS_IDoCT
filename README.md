# BWAS_IDoCT

To use these models do as follows:
- install the environment
- Download data
- Running the code
## Installing the environment
The GNN_fMRI.yml file contains the necessary packages to run the fMRI_GNN model and the fMRI_sMRI model. With conda installed, you can create the environment as follows:

```
conda env create --file GNN_fMRI.yml
```
## The data
Three datasets are required to run all this code. They are the resting-state fMRI correlation matrices, the sMRI data and the cognitive data from the cogntive test. This data was received from the UKBiobank.

## Running the code
### rs-fMRI GNN model


### rs-fMRI and sMRI model
